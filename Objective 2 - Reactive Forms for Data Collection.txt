Reactive Forms for Data Collection
1/30/2026

Objectives:

• Understand the purpose and advantages of using Reactive Forms in Angular for data collection.
• Learn how to create and configure FormGroup, FormControl, and FormArray structures.
• Implement client-side validation using built‑in, custom, and asynchronous validators.
• Display clear and user-friendly error messages based on form control state.
• Practice building dynamic and nested forms to support more complex data-entry scenarios.
• Apply best practices for robust, accessible, and maintainable form design.

Instructions:

• Create a new Angular component dedicated to collecting user input using Reactive Forms Links to an external site.
• Set up a FormGroup that contains at least three FormControl elements with appropriate default values.
• Add validation rules to each form control. Include at least one custom validator and one asynchronous validator.
• Build the HTML form and bind all controls using the Reactive Forms directives.
• Display validation error messages beneath each field when the user interacts with the form or attempts to submit it.
• Include at least one dynamic form section using FormArray, allowing the user to add or remove repeated fields.
• Implement a submit function that checks form validity and logs the final form value to the console.
• Test your form by entering various valid and invalid values to ensure all validation logic works as expected.
