• Open your global styles file:
        • src/styles.css or src/styles.scss
        • Add the Tailwind directives to the top of the file: @import "tailwindcss";
• Apply Tailwind CSS utility classes in the component:
        • Use spacing classes such as padding and margin
        • Use at least one background color class
        • Use text size and text color classes
